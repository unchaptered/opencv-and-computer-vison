# Numpy & Image Basics

[What is numpy?](./README.md#11-numpy1151)

In this docs, we use numpy to calculate for arrays.

## 1. Dependencies

- [x] numpy=1.15.1
- [x] matplotlib=2.2.3
- [x] pillow=5.2.0

### 1.1. numpy@1.15.1

This section is written by [numpy@1.15.1](https://numpy.org/doc/1.15/user/whatisnumpy.html) in 2023-01-10.

Numpy is python opensource library to handle these...

1. Multidimensional array object (다차원 배열 객체)
2. Various derived object (다차원 파생 객체)
    1. Masked arrays
    2. Masked matrices
3. Assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays

multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays

> Because numpy is build on `C`, it is very fast other calculation library such as SciPy.
> [What is the difference between NumPy and SciPy in Python?](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-the-difference-between-numpy-and-scipy-in-python)

> And numpy is more higher compatible than `Arrays of Pathon`. Most other library is supported by numpy.

### 1.2. matplotlib@2.2.3

This section is writted by [matplotlib@2.2.3](https://matplotlib.org/2.2.4/index.html) in 2023-01-10.

> Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.
>
> Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code. For examples, see the sample plots and thumbnail gallery.
>
> For simple plotting the pyplot module provides a MATLAB-like interface, particularly when combined with IPython. For the power user, you have full control of line styles, font properties, axes properties, etc, via an object oriented interface or via a set of functions familiar to MATLAB users.


### 1.3. pillow@5.2.0

This section is written by [pillow@5.2.0](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/5.2.0.html) in 2023-01-10.
